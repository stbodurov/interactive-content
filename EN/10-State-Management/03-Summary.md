# Summary

## In this lesson you learned:

- NgRx Store is a powerful State Management solution
  - Install using `npm install @ngrx/store`


- Actions in NgRx Store
  - Have a `type` in the form of a string
  - Contain a payload of data

```js
import { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';

// An action to increment
export const increment = createAction(
  '[Counter Component] Increment'
)

```

- Reducers are responsible for handling transitions from one state to another
  - They are pure functions
  - Determine which action to handle based on the action's type


```js
import { createReducer, on } from '@ngrx/store';
import { increment, decrement, reset } from './counter.actions';
 
export const initialState = 0;
 
const _counterReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(increment, (state) => state + 1),
  on(decrement, (state) => state - 1),
  on(reset, (state) => 0)
);
 
export function counterReducer(state, action) {
  return _counterReducer(state, action);
}

```
